            <h1>1) Eat a Healthy Diet</h1>
            <img class="image" src="project_images\diet.jpg">
            <p>A healthy diet is essential for good health and nutrition.It protects you against many chronic noncommunicable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Eating a variety of foods and consuming less salt, sugars and saturated and
                industrially-produced trans-fats, are essential for healthy diet.</p>

            <h1 data-aos="fade-up">2) Consume less Salt and Sugar</h1>
            <img class="image" src="project_images\salt_sugar.jpg" data-aos="fade-up">
            <p data-aos="fade-up">Consuming excessive amounts of sugars increases the risk of tooth decay and unhealthy weight gain. In both adults and children, the intake of free sugars should be reduced to less than 10% of total energy intake. This is equivalent to 50g
                or about 12 teaspoons for an adult. WHO recommends consuming less than 5% of total energy intake for additional health benefits. You can reduce your sugar intake by limiting the consumption of sugary snacks, candies and sugar-sweetened
                beverages.
            </p>

            <h1 data-aos="fade-up">3) Avoid use of alcohol</h1>
            <img class="image" src="project_images\alcohol.jpg" data-aos="fade-up">
            <p data-aos="fade-up">There is no safe level for drinking alcohol. Consuming alcohol can lead to health problems such as mental and behavioural disorders, including alcohol dependence, major NCDs such as liver cirrhosis, some cancers and heart diseases, as well
                as injuries resulting from violence and road clashes and collisions.</p>

            <h1 data-aos="fade-up">4) Don't smoke</h1>
            <img class="image" src="project_images\smoke.jpg" data-aos="fade-up">
            <p data-aos="fade-up">Smoking tobacco causes NCDs such as lung disease, heart disease and stroke. Tobacco kills not only the direct smokers but even non-smokers through second-hand exposure. Currently, there are around 15.9 million Filipino adults who smoke tobacco
                but 7 in 10 smokers are interested or plan to quit. If you are currently a smoker, it’s not too late to quit. Once you do, you will experience immediate and long-term health benefits. If you are not a smoker, that’s great! Do not start
                smoking and fight for your right to breathe tobacco-smoke-free air.</p>

            <h1 data-aos="fade-up">5) Be active</h1>
            <img class="image" src="project_images\active.jpg" data-aos="fade-up">
            <p data-aos="fade-up">Physical activity is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure. This includes exercise and activities undertaken while working, playing, carrying out household chores, travelling, and engaging
                in recreational pursuits. The amount of physical activity you need depends on your age group but adults aged 18-64 years should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity throughout the week. Increase moderate-intensity
                physical activity to 300 minutes per week for additional health benefits.</p>

            <h1 data-aos="fade-up">6) Talk to someone you trust if you're feeling down</h1>
            <img class="image" src="project_images\sad.jpg" data-aos="fade-up">
            <p data-aos="fade-up">Depression is a common illness worldwide with over 260 million people affected. Depression can manifest in different ways, but it might make you feel hopeless or worthless, or you might think about negative and disturbing thoughts a lot or
                have an overwhelming sense of pain. If you’re going through this, remember that you are not alone. Talk to someone you trust such as a family member, friend, colleague or mental health professional about how you feel.</p>

            <h1 data-aos="fade-up">7) Wash hands properly</h1>
            <img src="project_images/wash_hands.jpg" data-aos="fade-up">
            <p data-aos="fade-up">Hand hygiene is critical not only for health workers but for everyone. Clean hands can prevent the spread of infectious illnesses. You should handwash using soap and water when your hands are visibly soiled or handrub using an alcohol-based
                product.
            </p>

            <h1 data-aos="fade-up">8) Get enough Sleep</h1>
            <img src="project_images/sleep.jpg" data-aos="fade-up">
            <p data-aos="fade-up">The importance of getting enough quality sleep cannot be overstated.Poor sleep can drive insulin resistance, can disrupt your appetite hormones, and reduce your physical and mental performance.What’s more, poor sleep is one of the strongest
                individual risk factors for weight gain and obesity. People who do not get enough sleep tend to make food choices that are higher in fat, sugar, and calories, potentially leading to unwanted weight gain.</p>

            <h1 data-aos="fade-up">9) Exercise Regularly</h1>
            <img src="project_images/exercise.jpg" data-aos="fade-up">
            <p data-aos="fade-up">Doing aerobic exercise, or cardio, is one of the best things you can do for your mental and physical health.It’s particularly effective at reducing belly fat, the harmful type of fat that builds up around your organs. Reduced belly fat may
                lead to major improvements in your metabolic health.According to the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, we should strive for at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity each week.</p>

            <h1 data-aos="fade-up">10) Stay hydrated</h1>
            <img src="project_images/hydrate.jpg" data-aos="fade-up">
            <p data-aos="fade-up">Hydration is an important and often overlooked marker of health. Staying hydrated helps ensure that your body is functioning optimally and that your blood volume is sufficient.Drinking water is the best way to stay hydrated, as it’s free of
                calories, sugar, and additives.Although there’s no set amount that everyone needs per day, aim to drink enough so that your thirst is adequately quenched.</p>
